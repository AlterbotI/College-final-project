<span style="font-size: 40px;color: #0000008a;">"</span>The significance of Technicina and Technical Education for economy of a country is prominent due to the industrial and revolution which have  changed the world face.The growth,
production and proper function of an industry largely depends on the pyramids of productive work force i.e Engineer.Associate Engineer and skill worker An Associate engineer occupies the most 
important and middile position in the pyramid of the productive work force .Though the skill worker on Associate Engineer shapes up the ideas of engineer into reality.The main source of production 
of Assoicate Engineers are college technologies,Polytechnics and Technical Institutes
Soon after the independence of pakistan in 1947 it was discoverd that there was an acute shortage of technical institutes in the country In view of the goverment constituted"council of Technical 
Eduction for Pakistan" in june 1948.The Council recommended a scheme of polytechnics,monotechnics and Technical Insititutes with a post matric three year Diploma of Associate Engineer (D.A.E) Course
in september,1950
To accelerate the development of Technical Education,In 1958 the directorate of technical education was setup at lahore.The commision on national Education (December 1958) recoginzed the importance
of Technical Education for economical progress and defined its place in the system of education.By the end of 1962 it became clear on that only one direction of Technical Education for the whole country of
Pakistan is inadequate.Therefore another Directorate of Technical Rducation was established at karachi in feb,1964.Presently all provinces have setup their own boards of technical education 
with their respective names.Technical and vocational training authority has been constituted to over sight technical education in Pakistan.</p>
